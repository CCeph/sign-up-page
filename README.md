# sign-up-page
A sign up page for an imaginary game.

This project will display my ability to create and style the
front-end for forms.

This is a sign-up page for a fictional game that does not exist.
The scope of the project only focuses on this one webpage, so the
rest of the website will not be made. Note that there is no backend for
this sign-up sheet, so the information filled in does not go anywhere.
My main focus is to display my ability to create and design the
front-end of a sign-up sheet.

Acknowledged limitations:
    The "Confirm Your Password" field does not actually check if the
    passwords match.

Remaining work to be executed:

    Add "*" to every form element that is required.

    Make sure that there is validation checking for required
    form elements.

    Highlight form elements in red when they are invalid. Only
    after the form has been submitted once, or information was
    filled in.

    Adjust the default suggestion drop-down menu when focusing on
    the character name field.

    Adjust the text of the validation messages.
        Password validation should mention the password limit
        only if the user exceeded it.
